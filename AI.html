How AI works
AI systems receive data from humans, and then produce a recommendation based on algorithms. 
AI can recognize images, understand and respond to language, and learn from new information. 
AI can process large amounts of data quickly, which helps it find patterns and solve complex problems. 
Examples of AI
Optical character recognition (OCR): Uses AI to extract text and data from images and documents 
Voice assistants: Like Siri and Alexa, which are based on AI technology 
Customer service chatbots: Which help you navigate websites 
Self-driving cars: Which can act independently, replacing the need for human intervention 
Benefits of AI
