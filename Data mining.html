             Data mining is the process of finding patterns and correlations in large data sets. It uses a combination of machine learning, statistics, and database systems. 
How does data mining work?
Data preparation: Raw data from different sources is cleaned and converted to a standard format. This includes removing errors, finding missing values, and removing duplicates. 
Pattern discovery: Data mining techniques look for patterns in the data, such as associations between items, or sequences of events. 
Model creation: Analytical models are built based on the patterns found in the data. 
Model testing: Models are tested against hypotheses. 
Visualization: The results of data mining are presented using visualization tools. 
What are some data mining techniques?
Regression analysis: Predicts the value of a feature based on other features in the data 
Association rule learning: Finds relationships between items in transactions 
Clustering: Groups data points together based on their similarities 
Sequence and path analysis: Looks for patterns in which a set of events leads to later ones 
Why use data mining?
Data mining can help businesses increase revenues, cut costs, improve customer relationships, and reduce risks.
